This is the portfolio version 5. A portal on all things Salvador Villalon.

In the portfolio, you will find the following pages:
- **Now**: What I am currently focusing on. [You can make one too!](https://nownownow.com/).
- **About**: Quick intro on me.
- **Blog**: Writing straight from my mind.
- **Experience**: A history of my professional experience.
- **Gallery**: Pictures of my adventures.

## Implementation
- This time I finally learned responsive mobile development so now the app is mobile friendly.
- Implemented with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)
    - Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS. (Did not use tRPC or Prisma, but maybe in the future I will)
